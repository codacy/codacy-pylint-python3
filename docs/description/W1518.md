# Method Cache Max Size None (W1518)

'lru_cache(maxsize=None)' or 'cache' will keep all method args alive
indefinitely, including 'self' By decorating a method with lru_cache or
cache the 'self' argument will be linked to the function and therefore
never garbage collected. Unless your instance will never need to be
garbage collected (singleton) it is recommended to refactor code to
avoid this pattern or add a maxsize to the cache. The default value for
maxsize is 128.
