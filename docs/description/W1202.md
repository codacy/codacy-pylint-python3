# Logging Format Interpolation (W1202)

Use %s formatting in logging functions Used when a logging statement has
a call form of "logging.(format_string.format(format_args...))". Use
another type of string formatting instead. You can use % formatting but
leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as
arguments. If logging-fstring- interpolation is disabled then you can
use fstring formatting. If logging- not-lazy is disabled then you can
use % formatting as normal.
