# logging-format-interpolation (W1202)

*Use %s formatting in logging functions* Used when a logging statement
has a call form of "logging.\<logging
method\>(format_string.format(format_args...))". Use another type of
string formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave
interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as
arguments. If logging-fstring- interpolation is disabled then you can
use fstring formatting. If logging- not-lazy is disabled then you can
use % formatting as normal.
