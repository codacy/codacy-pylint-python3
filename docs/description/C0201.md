# Consider Iterating Dictionary (C0201)

Consider iterating the dictionary directly instead of calling .keys()
Emitted when the keys of a dictionary are iterated through the .keys()
method or when .keys() is used for a membership check. It is enough to
iterate through the dictionary itself, for key in dictionary. For
membership checks, if key in dictionary is faster.
