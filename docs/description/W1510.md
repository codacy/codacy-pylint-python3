# subprocess-run-check (W1510)

'subprocess.run' used without explicitly defining the value for 'check'.
The check keyword is set to False by default. It means the process
launched by subprocess.run can exit with a non-zero exit code and fail
silently. It's better to set it explicitly to make clear what the error-
handling behavior is.
