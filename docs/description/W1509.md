# subprocess-popen-preexec-fn (W1509)

Using preexec_fn keyword which may be unsafe in the presence of threads
The preexec_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of threads
in your application. The child process could deadlock before exec is
called. If you must use it, keep it trivial! Minimize the number of
libraries you call into. See
