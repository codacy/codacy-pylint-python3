# bidirectional-unicode (E2502)

*Contains control characters that can permit obfuscated code executed
differently than displayed* bidirectional unicode are typically not
displayed characters required to display right-to-left (RTL) script
(i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, ...) correctly. So can you
trust this code? Are you sure it displayed correctly in all editors? If
you did not write it or your language is not RTL, remove the special
characters, as they could be used to trick you into executing code, that
does something else than what it looks like. More Information:
