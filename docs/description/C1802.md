# use-implicit-booleaness-not-len (C1802)

*Do not use \`len(SEQUENCE)\` without comparison to determine if a
sequence is empty* Used when Pylint detects that len(sequence) is being
used without explicit comparison inside a condition to determine if a
sequence is empty. Instead of coercing the length to a boolean, either
rely on the fact that empty sequences are false or compare the length
against a scalar.
