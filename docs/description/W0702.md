# bare-except (W0702)

No exception type(s) specified A bare except: clause will catch
SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt exceptions, making it harder to
interrupt a program with Control-C, and can disguise other problems. If
you want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use except
Exception: (bare except is equivalent to except BaseException:).
