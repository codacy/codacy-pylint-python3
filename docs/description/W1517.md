# cache-max-size-none (W1517)

*'lru_cache(maxsize=None)' will keep all method args alive indefinitely,
including 'self'* By decorating a method with lru_cache the 'self'
argument will be linked to the lru_cache function and therefore never
garbage collected. Unless your instance will never need to be garbage
collected (singleton) it is recommended to refactor code to avoid this
pattern or add a maxsize to the cache.The default value for maxsize is
128.
