# modified-iterating-list (W4701)

*Iterated list '%s' is being modified inside for loop body, consider
iterating through a copy of it instead.* Emitted when items are added or
removed to a list being iterated through. Doing so can result in
unexpected behaviour, that is why it is preferred to use a copy of the
list.
