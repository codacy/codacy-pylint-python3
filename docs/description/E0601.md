# used-before-assignment (E0601)

*Using variable %r before assignment* Emitted when a local variable is
accessed before its assignment took place. Assignments in try blocks are
assumed not to have occurred when evaluating associated except/finally
blocks. Assignments in except blocks are assumed not to have occurred
when evaluating statements outside the block, except when the associated
try block contains a return statement.
