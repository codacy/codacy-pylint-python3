# raise-missing-from (W0707)

Consider explicitly re-raising using %s'%s from %s' Python's exception
chaining shows the traceback of the current exception, but also of the
original exception. When you raise a new exception after another
exception was caught it's likely that the second exception is a friendly
re- wrapping of the first exception. In such cases raise from provides a
better link between the two tracebacks in the final error.
