# consider-using-in (R1714)

Consider merging these comparisons with 'in' by using '%s %sin (%s)'.
Use a set instead if elements are hashable. To check if a variable is
equal to one of many values, combine the values into a set or tuple and
check if the variable is contained "in" it instead of checking for
equality against each of the values. This is faster and less verbose.
