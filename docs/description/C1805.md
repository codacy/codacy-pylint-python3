# use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-zero (C1805)

"%s" can be simplified to "%s", if it is strictly an int, as 0 is falsey
0 is considered false in a boolean context. Following this check blindly
in weakly typed code base can create hard to debug issues. If the value
can be something else that is falsey but not an int (for example None,
an empty string, or an empty sequence) the code will not be equivalent.
