# Comparison Of Constants (R0133)

Comparison between constants: '%s %s %s' has a constant value When two
literals are compared with each other the result is a constant. Using
the constant directly is both easier to read and more performant.
Initializing 'True' and 'False' this way is not required since Python
2.3.
