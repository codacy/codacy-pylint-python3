# use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string (C1804)

"%s" can be simplified to "%s", if it is strictly a string, as an empty
string is falsey Empty string are considered false in a boolean context.
Following this check blindly in weakly typed code base can create hard
to debug issues. If the value can be something else that is falsey but
not a string (for example None, an empty sequence, or 0) the code will
not be equivalent.
