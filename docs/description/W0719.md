# Broad Exception Raised (W0719)

Raising too general exception: %s Raising exceptions that are too
generic force you to catch exceptions generically too. It will force you
to use a naked except Exception: clause. You might then end up catching
exceptions other than the ones you expect to catch. This can hide bugs
or make it harder to debug programs when unrelated errors are hidden.
